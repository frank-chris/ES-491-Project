# Simulating the Natural Selection of Speed in a Population of Animals üî•

Simulating the natural selection of speed in a population of animals living in an environment with finite food resources using NetLogo. This project was a part of the course `ES-491: Modeling and Simulation of Complex Systems`  offered at IIT Gandhinagar in Semester-2 AY 2020-21 under the guidance of Prof. Antonio Fonseca.

### Objectives

The aim of this project is to study the evolution of the trait ‚Äòspeed‚Äô through natural selection in a population of animals living in a simple environment with finite food resources.  Studying the emergence of a value for the average speed of the population and investigating factors that could influence it are also important goals of this project.
